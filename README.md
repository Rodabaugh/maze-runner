# Boot.dev Asteroids Project

I'm creating this project as a part of the Boot.Dev backend developer course.

# What is this?

This program generates a maze and then solves it using Depth First Search. The maze is different each time the program is ran. 

# Usage

Ensure you have Python 3 installed with tkinter.

Download the zip file for the repo.

Start the program with python3 main.py

The program will first create a grid of cells. It'll then generate the maze on that grid. Finally, it'll solve the maze using DFS. Rerun the program to get a different maze.
